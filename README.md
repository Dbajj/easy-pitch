# EasyPitch

EasyPitch is a work in progress chromatic guitar tuner for Android devices. 

It utilizes the McLeod Pitch Method, including the FFT based optimizations noted in the paper, to provide fast and accurate
pitch detection across a variety of instruments, and will feature customizable tunings alongside a simple detailed interface. 

Work is ongoing, and the project structure will likely change significantly over the coming iterations.
